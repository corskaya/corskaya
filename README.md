## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ã‡aÄŸrÄ±, from Turkey.

I graduated from Istanbul University, Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department in September 2021. <br />
I have been working on web programming for about 1.5 years and my goal is to become a Full-Stack Developer. <br />
Previously, I have developed various applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript languages and frameworks like React, Angular and Bootstrap on the front end part. On the back end part, I am at the stage of learning Node.js and .Net technologies right now.
